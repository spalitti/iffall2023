        <h2>Slop cookies</h2>
            <p> You may be wondering why the name of this recipe includes the word 'slop'. It has been observed by my roomates that I seem to have a penchant for homogenous foods, or what they like to refer to as 'slop'. I assure you that these breakfast cookies are a delicious way to start your day, despite the designation they have been given. That being said, since they are a breakfast item, they are less sweet than the traditional cookie. The mix-ins that I usually like (cranberries, coconut and chocolate chips) can be substituted for any other dried fruit, nut, or 'chip'. </p>

        <h3>instructions</h3>
            <p> 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees<br>
                2. Combine the ground flaxseeds with the water and allow to gel for 5 minutes.<br> 
                In a bowl combine the melted butter and sugar and whisk together well. Pour in the vanilla and flax egg and whisk again until fully incorporated.<br>
                3. In a separate bowl combine the flour, oats, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Mix together and then pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.<br>
                4. With a spatula fold the ingredients together until most of the flour is combined then pour in the coconut flakes, dried fruit and chocolate chips. Fold everything together until you form a sticky dough. <br>
                5. Scoop up about 2 tbsp of dough and roll into a dough ball to place on a baking sheet and lightly flatten the dough. Repeat with remaining dough making sure to give enough space for the dough to spread when it bakes.<br>
                6. Place the cookies in the oven to bake for 13-18 minutes (until they are lightly browned). Remove from the oven, let the cookies rest on the tray until cooled, then enjoy!<br>
                7. I normally store cookies loosely covered or in a tupperware on the counter for up to a week.<br>
