                Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else<br>
                You steam a lens stable eyes and glass<br>
                Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news<br>
                Still we can find our love down from behind<br>
                Down far behind this fabulous, my turn rules<br><br>
                
                Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and then blued<br>
                Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else<br><br>
                
                You steam a lens stable eyes and glass<br>
                Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news<br>
                You'll hang the hearts black and dull as the night<br>
                We hanged your pass and start being as you in ecstasy<br><br>
                
                Still being cried and laughed at before<br>
                Should I be sewn in hugged I can by not saying<br>
                Still being cried and laughed at from light to blue<br>
                And should I be hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque<br><br>
                
                And should I be sung and unbroken by not saying<br>
                You mind not saying<br>
                He'll hang that heart's black and dull as the night<br><br>
                
                Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains<br>
                We hanged your pass and star being as you in ecstasy<br>
                Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains<br>
                Should I be sung and unbroken by not saying<br>
                Still being cried and laughed at from behind me, from gains<br>
                Hugged and tugged down through this tiger's masque for key<br><br></p>
