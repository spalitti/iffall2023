                EASY TO TAKE CARE OF
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                When you own pet animals, you need to invest your time to take care of them. Snakes are not different from this. But it is easier to take care of them. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                You should interact with your pet snake every day. You can allow it to coil around your arm, drape over your shoulders. You can leave it in a big room to explore. But you should be careful so that it cannot interact with other pet animals, especially small creatures. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Like other pets, snakes do not need very much human interaction. You can just keep a small time for interaction with your pet snake. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                To take care of them, keep their tank and enclosure clean, check them regularly, and observe if any signs appear that they may be sick or unwell. Corn snakes or other beginner snakes are hardly seen to be sick. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                REQUIRE MINIMAL EXERCISE <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                A pet snake requires minimal exercise. Other pet animals require a daily walk in the park or an open field. You lose your energy for this task. But pet snakes don’t require this. As a result, you can stay relaxed and no need to spend extra energy. <br>
            </p>

They often enter your home and you may be in an uncomfortable situation for these pets. But snakes are not like them. Pet snakes spend a happy time in their captive habitat. So, you will not be bothered by them.  <br>

                SNAKES ARE LOW MAINTENANCE <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                When you ask why snakes are good pets, probably the best answer is- snakes are of low maintenance compared to other pet animals. When you own any pet like a cat or a dog, you have to take all the responsibilities of that animal. Other animals need a lot of time and effort for their maintenance. But snakes can give you relief as it needs low maintenance.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Snakes don’t need to be walked, they don’t shed, and most of the time, they like to stay in their captive enclosure. That makes them an ideal apartment pet, or a pet for someone who can’t handle the rigorous schedule of a more mainstream pet. Moreover, you can easily clean up your snake’s captive habitat in case of infrequent defecation. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Normally, you have to feed them only once a week. Big snakes often eat once every two weeks, sometimes once in the whole month. But regardless of your snake is small or big, they need lower maintenance for feeding. When you go outside of your home for a long time, you can be tension-free for your snake. <br>

                SNAKES ARE DOCILE PETS <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Though a pet snake may look cool and threatening, it is pretty docile. They can range in sociability, but they are usually happy to just hang out in their tank, and respond pretty well to being handled, as long as you start them when they are young. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Corn Snake, Hognose Snake, Ball Python, Kenyan Sand Boa, etc are the most docile pet snakes. As beautiful as the snakes are, large and venomous snakes are not recommended as pets. Because they may be harmful and dangerous for you and your family. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                EASY TO HOUSE <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Pet snakes need an easy and comfortable place to digest their food, shed, and sleep. But keeping them happy is pretty easy. A clear 20-gallon terrarium lined with shavings will do the trick. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                All snakes need to regulate their body temperature by moving between warmer and cooler areas. They need a higher temperature than you are probably used to keeping in your home. Most tropical snakes need a temperature between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 70 to 75 degrees at night. Remember to get a sufficient heat source with a UV lamp. Snakes are cold-blooded, and they need extra light and heat to stay healthy.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Make sure that there is a “cool” side of your snake’s home to escape to if they get too warm. Most snake experts warn against keeping heating elements such as rocks inside the enclosure as the snake can easily overheat or get burned. The snake’s enclosure should get about 10 to 12 hours of daylight and 12 to 14 hours of darkness each day.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                You have to use some sort of bedding material in the bottom of their enclosure. Butcher paper, newspaper, terry cloth towels, etc. are good materials for this task. Indoor or outdoor carpet is also perfect as it is safe and easy to clean. Pet snakes also need a private area to feed well and feel secured. <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                Snakes are very good escape artists. So, make sure that you have prepared a captive habitat that is completely escape-proof. Snakes are always expert and steady about finding and escaping through any small gaps. Just make sure that they can’t open the top of the enclosure as they are exercising.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                NO LOUD NOISES <br>
            </p>
            <p class="column">
                When you own a pet animal, you have to tolerate its noise. Your neighbors may feel embarrassed because of its noise. But snakes can give relief because they don’t create loud noises. Amazingly, you own a pet animal but it doesn’t create any loud noise and you can stay in a calm environment. <br>
