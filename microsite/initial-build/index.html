            Destigmatizing Snakes
        </h2>
        <p>
            only about 600 species of snakes are venomous, and only about 200 (7%) are able to kill or significantly wound a human. Humans die more from mosquitoes than snakes. Mosquitoes are responsible for about a million deaths each year, while snakes are only responsible for about fifty thousand deaths each year across the globe. Even humans kill each other more than snakes do. Humans are responsible for about four hundred seventy-five deaths of their fellow man each year, and dogs follow very closely behind snakes. This raises the question, if so many other things are way more dangerous than snakes, why do people hate and fear snakes so much?

            Snakes make great companion animals. Snakes do not require walks in the park; they are quiet animals, and easy to care for. Some snakes, like ball pythons, can live for twenty to thirty years. Snakes  donâ€™t eat nearly as much as cats and dogs. They only need to be fed an appropriately sized meal every week or two depending on the type and size of your snake.
