            <ol type= "1">
                <li>Hi! My name is Sophia Palitti and I am a junior studying communication design and art history</li>
                <li>I am taking this class as a communication design requirement, but I am excited to learn more about webdesign as it is definitely the field I am least experienced in</li>
                <li>I do not have any experience using html or css or javascript but look forward to learning</li>
                <li>I would like to learn how to (hopefully) build an interesting portfolio website</li>
                <li>I think there is a lot more difficulty accounting for the differences between screen sizes, and the way images/words appear (mobile vs ipad vs desktop, etc.)</li>
                <li><a href = "https://ahoystudios.com/ahoy"> AHOY</a> I really enjoy the style of this website, the use of all 4 corners is something that I feel is a bit uncommon with website design (especially using said 4 corners as main navigation tools). I also love the bright, vibrant colors and the use of black and white images in contrast to that.</li>
                <li><a href = "https://saffron-consultants.com/"> saffron</a> Saffron's website to me is more effective at just communicating their message, with a little bit less of the "bells and whistles" and a little more structure. However, both sites utilize and interactive cursor which I feel really adds to the user experience.</li>
                <li><a href = "https://chips.nyc/"> chips</a> The chips website is just so fun. It is simple, categorizing different links in a no-nonsense manner, and I think my mother would love this one (easy to use). It is effective and navigable</li>
